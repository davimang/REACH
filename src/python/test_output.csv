0,NCT02017795,Asthma Self-management Via Application of Telehealth,"In our study design we propose to use a web-based application and inform asthma patients through weekly Text Message (SMS) reminders to take their controller medication regularly and also a message to visit the web-based e-AAP and assess the current level of asthma control. This will be a two-way interaction and personalized feedback protocol to monitor patients at home and during daily activities. We will use an adequate sample size to provide an interim analysis of efficacy and the subsequent total number of subjects that will need to be enrolled. Each patient (in the relevant group, as explained below) will have his/her own profile, which will enable us to send and receive personalized (exchange) information using a web application process via cell phones. This approach will allow interaction between patient and asthma care counselor/ provider aiming to improve asthma control.||This study will test the hypothesis that using mobile phone reminder messages and web-based monitoring, as part of a structured care plan, will improve clinical outcomes; namely reduction in the rate of exacerbation, in patients with asthma. We also aim to explore the cost-effectiveness of this technology. Our research group proposes to complete a feasibility study, with an interim analysis for a formal power calculation and then acquire ethics to report these results and study design with anticipated publication prior to proceeding with a full randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this intervention. We predict that using a combination of Internet and SMS messaging technology will empower patients to manage their asthma and eventually prevent asthma exacerbation based on their personalized action plan as well as a SMS application. We plan to compare the web-based/SMS reminder method with written action plan approach in a 24-month time frame, as explained later in this proposal.",Unknown status,3348.47,1,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02017795

87,NCT00921401,Improving the Quality of Asthma Care Using the Internet,"Asthma is a common cause of illness and lost productivity, including missed days of work and school, in the United States. It is important for people with asthma to become involved in their treatment and care. Previous studies have shown that encouraging people to ask their doctor for various medical tests and treatments improves preventive care (e.g., cancer screenings), but more research is needed on the effect this can have on asthma management. This study will involve an interactive Web site that will ask patients questions about their asthma symptoms and medications and provide suggestions and feedback on the types of questions patients may want to ask their doctors. By asking questions about their asthma care and increasing communication with their doctor, patients may experience improved quality of asthma care and better asthma control. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the interactive Web site on asthma control and other measures of asthma management.||This 12-month study will enroll people with asthma. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Asthma Feedback group or the Preventive Feedback (control) group. Both groups will log in to the study Web site at least once a month for 12 months and before all doctor visits. After logging in to the Web site, participants in the Asthma Feedback group will answer a series of questions about their asthma care. They will then receive information and feedback on the types of questions they should ask their asthma care provider during their next office visit. Participants in the Preventive Feedback group will answer questions and receive information and feedback regarding preventive services (e.g., cancer screening, cholesterol screening) that they should discuss with their primary care provider. At baseline and Months 6 and 12, all participants will complete online questionnaires regarding their asthma and overall health.

26,NCT00149461,Written Asthma Actions Plans Versus No Written Instructions In Specialty Care,"BACKGROUND:||Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients, or their caregivers, recognize the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the incorporation of a written self-management plan is essential. Patients must possess, understand, and follow a written plan if they are to respond appropriately to changes in asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled studies examining the efficacy of the written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and effective component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive these plans. If patients and physicians are to increase their use of written plans, the barriers to the use of these plans need further investigation.||DESIGN NARRATIVE:||The three primary outcome measures of this study are as follows: 1) reduction in asthma symptom frequency; 2) reduction in urgent, unscheduled, and emergency visits for asthma; and 3) improved quality of life. These outcomes will be measured over a 12-month period.||The following four secondary outcome measures will also be examined: 1) hospitalizations due to asthma; 2) days with activity restriction; 3) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who are given the model written plan form during the initial visit; and 4) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who have the model treatment plan at the end of the follow-up period.

35,NCT01708070,Trial of Asthma Self-Management Education in Patients With Depressive Symptoms,"Depressive and anxious conditions are common during the lifetime of asthma patients and have been shown to be associated with worse asthma as defined by more symptoms, more hospitalizations and greater use of medications. There have been few studies trying to improve asthma outcomes in patients with known depression. One method to improve outcomes is to instruct patients in ways to better self manage asthma. The goal of this study is to test a comprehensive intervention to improve asthma self-management by increasing knowledge and self-efficacy in patients with a known history of a positive screen for depression. Patients will be randomized to two groups - a control group and an intervention group. Patients in the control group will receive an asthma workbook, will make a contract to adopt behaviors they think will improve asthma, and will receive telephone follow-ups approximately every week for 8 weeks and then approximately every 2 months. Patients in the intervention group will receive these components plus they will be taught how to use a peak flow meter and specific chapters of the workbook will be used as templates for focused instruction during telephone follow-ups.

In the world approximately 300 million people have asthma but it is estimated that only 5% of these patients have severe asthma. Although ""severe asthma"" comprises a small fraction of the entire asthmatic population its share in the total economic burden of asthma is 80 percent. In Israel the prevalence of asthma among adult patients is about 5-6% but the prevalence of severe asthma is unknown.||The definition of severe asthma has been changed during the years. Most recently in 2009 the WHO agreed on a unified definition of ""severe asthma"" that would fit countries of different socioeconomic development [1]. Severe asthma includes now 3 different groups: group one ""untreated severe asthma"", group two ""difficult to treat severe asthma"" and group three ""treatment-resistant severe asthma"". As all asthmatic patients in Israel have easy access to medical care, the current study will deal with the last two groups (""difficult to treat asthma"" and ""treatment resistant asthma"").||AIMS Primary endpoints:||To identify the prevalence of severe asthma in the community according to the WHO definition of group two & three.|To assess whether anti-IgE therapy (Omalizumab), was considered in these groups of severe asthma.||Secondary endpoints:||To assess factors involved in ""difficult to treat asthma"" according to the WHO definition. Factors as patient compliance, presence of co-morbidities, symptoms of untreated potential asthma triggers including GE reflux, post nasal drip/atopic rhino-sinusitis, and intervening medications including NSAID and beta-blockers.|To asses the level of asthma control, level of patient follow-up care including asthma specialist visits, periodic PFT's and asthma education.|To assess the fraction of patients with severe asthma that is eligible to anti-IgE therapy according to the indications of the Israeli Ministry of Health (proven asthma, uncontrolled by high dose of combined ICS+LABA inhaler therapy + at least 2 courses of systemic corticosteroids in the last year + proven atopy to at least one perennial aeroallergen + IgE level of 30-1,500 IU/ml)||DESIGN:||A prospective non-blinded non-randomized observation study among the population insured by Clalit Medical Services (CMS) in the Sharon- Shomron Medical District in Israel.||PROTOCOL:||The study will include all patients at the age interval of 20-70 years with bronchial asthma treated by CMS, Sharon-Shomron district.
