NCT02017795,1,Asthma|Mixed Asthma With Acute Exacerbation,Asthma Self-management Via Application of Telehealth,"In our study design we propose to use a web-based application and inform asthma patients through weekly Text Message (SMS) reminders to take their controller medication regularly and also a message to visit the web-based e-AAP and assess the current level of asthma control. This will be a two-way interaction and personalized feedback protocol to monitor patients at home and during daily activities. We will use an adequate sample size to provide an interim analysis of efficacy and the subsequent total number of subjects that will need to be enrolled. Each patient (in the relevant group, as explained below) will have his/her own profile, which will enable us to send and receive personalized (exchange) information using a web application process via cell phones. This approach will allow interaction between patient and asthma care counselor/ provider aiming to improve asthma control.||This study will test the hypothesis that using mobile phone reminder messages and web-based monitoring, as part of a structured care plan, will improve clinical outcomes; namely reduction in the rate of exacerbation, in patients with asthma. We also aim to explore the cost-effectiveness of this technology. Our research group proposes to complete a feasibility study, with an interim analysis for a formal power calculation and then acquire ethics to report these results and study design with anticipated publication prior to proceeding with a full randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this intervention. We predict that using a combination of Internet and SMS messaging technology will empower patients to manage their asthma and eventually prevent asthma exacerbation based on their personalized action plan as well as a SMS application. We plan to compare the web-based/SMS reminder method with written action plan approach in a 24-month time frame, as explained later in this proposal.",19.0,85.0,Canada,British Columbia,Vancouver,V5Z 1M9,"Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Evaluation, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute",Unknown status,All,"asthma, mixed asthma, telehealth, action plan, exacerbation","Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1M9, Canada",3348.47,1

NCT00921401,88,Asthma,Improving the Quality of Asthma Care Using the Internet,"Asthma is a common cause of illness and lost productivity, including missed days of work and school, in the United States. It is important for people with asthma to become involved in their treatment and care. Previous studies have shown that encouraging people to ask their doctor for various medical tests and treatments improves preventive care (e.g., cancer screenings), but more research is needed on the effect this can have on asthma management. This study will involve an interactive Web site that will ask patients questions about their asthma symptoms and medications and provide suggestions and feedback on the types of questions patients may want to ask their doctors. By asking questions about their asthma care and increasing communication with their doctor, patients may experience improved quality of asthma care and better asthma control. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the interactive Web site on asthma control and other measures of asthma management.||This 12-month study will enroll people with asthma. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Asthma Feedback group or the Preventive Feedback (control) group. Both groups will log in to the study Web site at least once a month for 12 months and before all doctor visits. After logging in to the Web site, participants in the Asthma Feedback group will answer a series of questions about their asthma care. They will then receive information and feedback on the types of questions they should ask their asthma care provider during their next office visit. Participants in the Preventive Feedback group will answer questions and receive information and feedback regarding preventive services (e.g., cancer screening, cholesterol screening) that they should discuss with their primary care provider. At baseline and Months 6 and 12, all participants will complete online questionnaires regarding their asthma and overall health.

NCT00149461,27,Asthma,Written Asthma Actions Plans Versus No Written Instructions In Specialty Care,"BACKGROUND:||Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients, or their caregivers, recognize the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the incorporation of a written self-management plan is essential. Patients must possess, understand, and follow a written plan if they are to respond appropriately to changes in asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled studies examining the efficacy of the written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and effective component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive these plans. If patients and physicians are to increase their use of written plans, the barriers to the use of these plans need further investigation.||DESIGN NARRATIVE:||The three primary outcome measures of this study are as follows: 1) reduction in asthma symptom frequency; 2) reduction in urgent, unscheduled, and emergency visits for asthma; and 3) improved quality of life. These outcomes will be measured over a 12-month period.||The following four secondary outcome measures will also be examined: 1) hospitalizations due to asthma; 2) days with activity restriction; 3) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who are given the model written plan form during the initial visit; and 4) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who have the model treatment plan at the end of the follow-up period.

NCT01708070,36,Asthma|Depression|Anxiety,Trial of Asthma Self-Management Education in Patients With Depressive Symptoms,"Depressive and anxious conditions are common during the lifetime of asthma patients and have been shown to be associated with worse asthma as defined by more symptoms, more hospitalizations and greater use of medications. There have been few studies trying to improve asthma outcomes in patients with known depression. One method to improve outcomes is to instruct patients in ways to better self manage asthma. The goal of this study is to test a comprehensive intervention to improve asthma self-management by increasing knowledge and self-efficacy in patients with a known history of a positive screen for depression. Patients will be randomized to two groups - a control group and an intervention group. Patients in the control group will receive an asthma workbook, will make a contract to adopt behaviors they think will improve asthma, and will receive telephone follow-ups approximately every week for 8 weeks and then approximately every 2 months. Patients in the intervention group will receive these components plus they will be taught how to use a peak flow meter and specific chapters of the workbook will be used as templates for focused instruction during telephone follow-ups.

To detect from this database the asthmatic patients that are considered to have ""severe asthma"" according to the level of medication that is prescribed to them (adjusted on the basis of severe/refractory asthma definition by the ATS workshop consensus 2000) [2].||C. To detect the fraction of patients having co-morbidities and/or potential triggers (computerized title-diagnosis) that may interfere with asthma management (WHO group two: potentially ""difficult to treat severe asthma""). Severe asthmatics without these co-morbidities /triggers will be considered as having WHO group three ""treatment resistant severe asthma"".||D. To detect the fraction of the patients with ""severe asthma"" that underwent evaluation for anti IgE-therapy.||E. To evaluate a sample of the above ""severe asthma"" population (WHO groups two and three) in the asthma outpatient clinic in Meir Hospital (estimated on the basis of preliminary data, 200-250 patients). If the absolute number of patients in either WHO group two or group three will not exceed 150, all patients will be invited. If the number will exceed 150, then each second patient, consecutively according to the computerized list, will be invited.||F. Patients invited to the asthma outpatient clinic will be evaluated by a pulmonary physician and complete a specific questionnaire regarding asthma control level (including non-scheduled use of medical resources), medication adherence, co-morbidities, smoking history, potential asthma triggers, level of asthma education, quality of follow-up care and potential adverse events in patients receiving anti-IgE therapy that are possibly related to this specific therapy.||G. All patients will undergo post bronchodilator spirometric evaluation, assessment of blood cell counts for peripheral eosinophils, total IgE blood levels and skin testing for aeroallergens.||H. Stages F and G of this protocol will be accomplished in one visit and there will be no more outpatint visits under this study.||Inclusion criteria:||A. Age 20-70 years old||B. A computerized diagnosis-title of ""bronchial asthma"", at any stage of severity. A subgroup of the above asthmatic patients will be considered as having ""severe asthma"" according to the ATS workshop consensus definition of severe/refractory asthma, based on the level of prescribed medication criteria 2000:||C. An obligatory criteria of at least 12 month inhaler-therapy prescription of a combination of high dose corticosteroid +LABA (at least 12 inhalers of Symbicort 160/4.5 mcg OR at least 10 inhalers of Seretide 500 mcg, a year) PLUS at least one of the following criteria:||D. Prescription of SABA, either Ventolin OR Bricalin inhalers at least once a quarter of a year or at least 4 inhalers in 12 months OR at least one prescription a month of inhalation-solution of Ventolin or Bricalin a month.||E. Prescription of an oral or IM corticosteroid, at least twice in the last 12 months.||The fulfilment of the above mentioned criteria indicates that these asthmatic patients are not conrolled, according to the GINA definition of controlled asthma.||Asthmatics that potentially have ""difficult to treat severe asthma"" due to co-morbidities or potential triggering factors will be sub-grouped according to these criteria (criteria for potential exclusion of having ""treatment resistant severe asthma""):||A. Having computerized title-diagnosis of COPD, congestive heart failure, smoking, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease.||B. Prescription of an oral or topical (ocular) beta-blockers.",20.0,70.0,,,,,,Unknown status,All,"Severe Asthma, Community, comorbidities, patient compliance,PFT, anti-IgE therapy",,999999999.0,0
