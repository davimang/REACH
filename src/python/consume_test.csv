NCT00224198,Lung Disease|Bronchitis|Emphysema|COPD|Asthma,Evaluation of the Lungs of Individuals With Lung Disease,"Patients will undergo a general medical evaluation by a pulmonary physician (and consultants as appropriate for other organs). The typical routine medical studies to be carried out may include: chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral), non-contrast high resolution CT scan of the chest, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, general hematologic studies, general serologic studies, /immunologic studies, biochemical analyses (including carboxyhemoglobin to measure blood carbon monoxide levels in order to accurately evaluate the diffusion capacity in individuals who smoke since smoking increases the blood levels of carbon monoxide), alcohol blood test, urinalysis, urine chemistries (including blood or urine nicotine and cotinine test to evaluate urine for active or passive exposure to nicotine), blood or urine drug screening (to evaluate use of recreational drugs and/or mood altering medications), pregnancy test (if applicable) and HIV serology. Also, a sweat chloride and sweat rate test may be performed by the physician to evaluate participants with a possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.||The study individual will undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy with a combination of bronchial brushing and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and/or bronchial wall biopsy. The primary factor for determining if an individual will have bronchial alveolar lavages (BAL) and/or brushings and/or biopsies is the particular lung disease affecting the individual. This will depend on the known mechanism relevant to the pathogenesis of the particular disease. For example, in individuals with asthma, the samples may include airway brushing and airway biopsies; in contrast, in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sampling may include airway brushings, airway biopsies, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Other determining factors include: the amount of moderate sedation (if used) and the amount of analgesia used; the maximal dosage of topical lidocaine that is allowed per procedure; allergic reactions to any of the medications used in the procedures; and individual's tolerance to the procedure."
NCT02369575,"Lung Diseases, Interstitial",Identification of Novel Markers of Human Lung Disease,"This research study is being conducted to learn about the progression and cause of lung disease. By agreeing to be a part of this study, you will allow the lung tissue which would normally have been discarded after your procedure, to be used for research purposes to allow us to understand more about your condition which may potentially lead to novel treatments and therapeutics. For this study, the investigators will isolate specific cells from the lung tissue and measure cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for regulating lung disease. No other type of research will be performed on these samples nor will the samples be given to other investigators for unrelated research."

NCT04930666,"Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive|Lung Diseases, Interstitial",BREATHE ALD: A Shared Decision-Making Intervention for Adults With Advanced Lung Disease,"This study addresses the important problem of adults with symptomatic advanced lung disease (ALD) who are at high risk for poor outcomes. Palliative care (PCare) improves the quality of life of individuals and their caregivers through the prevention and relief of suffering by identifying, assessing and treating the physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems associated with life-threatening illness. However, pulmonary clinicians rarely refer adults with ALD to PCare because of time demands, a lack of confidence in PCare and the perceived threat PCare poses to the relationship they have established with the ALD adult. Therefore, we are developing BREATHE-ALD (BRief intervention to Enhance Adherence to Treatment and HEalth advice in Advanced Lung Disease [ALD]), a novel shared decision-making (SDM) intervention to improve outcomes for adults with ALD.||The study includes two phases: (1) a development phase to develop BREATHE-ALD using interviews with 10 ALD adults and their caregivers with expert review to adapt BREATHE, and (2) a pilot validation phase conducting a pilot trial in which 10 adults with ALD receive BREATHE-ALD. We will follow adults with ALD for 3 months post-intervention to assess the impact of BREATHE-ALD on self-management and patient outcomes."
NCT02533583,Lung Diseases,Pulse Oximetry With Clinical Observation to Screen for Lung Disease in Neonates,"At present respiratory disease(RDS) diagnose base on clinical symptom and chest X-ray.But in china, because of the difference of medical conditions, some areas especially the basic level hospitals without the condition of X-ray examination, which can not be clearly diagnosed RDS.In 2013, the scholars analyzed the disease of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) need to be exposed to radiation, and RDS was in the first place. There is no conclusion whether it bad for newborn to exposure more. But in animal models, there is a correlation between exposure to radiation and cancer.||Hyaline membrane disease(HMD) is common occur in preterm infants .pulmonary surfactant(PS) is a safe and effective treatment for neonatalHMD.Bahadue F L meta analyse conclusion is early application of PS is more benefit for HMD.||So investigator hypothesize that pulse oximetry with clinical assessment have high sensitivity,specificity ,positive and negative predictive value to lung disease.The aim is to reduce radiation exposure to neonate and to preterm infants with RDS can early application of PS.||Symptomatic definition:with grunting,nasal flaring,retraction,cyanosis,tachypnea,stridor.||Pulse oximetry positive criteria:1.atrial oxygen saturation (SpO2)<90%;2.heart rate>180 or <100 per minute.||Clinical assessment:1.respiratory physical examination:non-symmetry,decrease breathing sound,bubbles sound.2.Delivery history:caesarean,premature rupture of membranes,liquor,mother conditions,Apgar score.||Congenital heart disease classification:1.critical:defects causing of the death or needing intervention before 28 days.2.serious:defects needing intervention before 1 year of age.significant:defects persisting longer than 6 months of age ,but not classified as critical or serious.4.non-significant:defects not physically appreciable and not persisting after 6 months of age."
NCT04100226,"Lung Diseases, Interstitial|Vitamin D Deficiency",Vitamin D Deficiency and Effect of Its Supplementation on Interstitial Lung Diseases(ILD).,Pulmonary fibrosis was due to chronic inflammation and disordered wound healing in response to damage induced by a variety of agents such as viral infection and radiotherapy or environmental toxins.it is characterized by accumulation of myofibroblasts and excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix.Epithelial cells undergoes epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT).||Supplementation with vitamin D or its analogs suppresses lung fibrosis via triggering anti-fibrotic effect through attenuation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B).vitamin D can reduce TGF-B expression and attenuate TGF-B induced epithelial mesenchymal transition in lung fibroblast and epithelial cells.
NCT03238989,Interstitial Lung Disease,Interstitial Lung Disease Registry Construction,"Interstitial lung disease refers to pulmonary disease that occurs in the interstitium of the lung.||It can be broadly classified into lung disease secondary to the cause of systemic disease or drug, and lung disease whose cause is unknown, and the latter is known as idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.||Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is a lung disease showing various aspects of inflammatory response and fibrosis reaction, and the cause of the onset is not accurately known yet, also there is no effective treatment.||Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, progresses very slowly, but sometimes acute exacerbation without any obvious cause leads to death, rapidly.||Therefore, it is important to collect data prospectively for changes in clinical features, pulmonary function, imaging findings, and quality of life of these patients.||A prospective study of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia will provide important information on the clinical characteristics and admission history of patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and the idiopathic interstitial pneumonia registry system will serve as the basis for further prospective observational studies.||The aim of this study is to establish the registry of patients with interstitial lung disease and to prospectively review the clinical features and progression of the patients."

NCT02168036,Lung Disease|Inflammation|Lung Cancer|Sarcoidosis,Study of Biologic Materials From the Mediastinal Lymph Nodes From Patients With Lung Disease.,"This study will use bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) as part of their diagnostic work up as recommended by the treating physician. The procedure will be performed as standard of care, either under general anesthesia in the operating room or in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation and analgesia. Bronchoscopy with EBUS-TBNA is normally an ambulatory procedure. During the procedure, biopsy needle will be passed through the tube and a small sample will be taken for both diagnostic and research purposes. Samples collected for diagnostic purposes will be sent to the Department of Pathology. Additional biopsy samples will be collected for research purposes. The subject is observed after the bronchoscopy, including vital signs and level of consciousness, until they are back to baseline. All subjects will be discharged with an escort as per Hospital policy. An overnight stay would be required for ambulatory individuals only if the individual is not, in the judgment of the treating attending physician, safe to be discharged as is standard practice."

NCT01583595,Chronic Lung Disease|Self-efficacy,"Self Efficacy, Walking Ability, Gait Speed and Physical Activity in People With Chronic Lung Disease",
NCT02960672,"Interstitial Lung Disease, Desquamative",Sequential Changes of Serum KL-6 Predict Progression in Interstitial Lung Disease,"The median follow-up period was 12 months, each patient received 4 or 5 follow-ups in our center, 336 person-times in study enrollment totally. The patients with interstitial lung disease had significantly higher serum baseline KL-6 and MMP-7 levels compared with healthy control.They divided into progressive group and non-progressive group according to disease change. Serum KL-6 and MMP-7 levels were elevated in patients if disease progression, but baseline level of biomarkers in progressive group were not significant higher compare with non-progressive group .Binary logistic regression showed △KL-6 and △MMP-7 were significant predictors for disease progression. Multivariate Cox analysis showed KL-6 and MMP-7 were significantly associated with survival along with other variables.||The serum levels of KL-6 and MMP-7 were elevated in the individuals with interstitial lung disease compared with healthy controls. The rate of poor prognosis and mortality more associated with the variability increased biomarker concentrations，rather than the baseline concentration.Therefore，Serial measurements of biomarkers contribute to the disease monitoring in clinical management."
