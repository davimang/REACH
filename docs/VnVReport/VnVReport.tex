\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}

\large{\textbf{User Data}}

\normalsize

\begin{enumerate}
  \item DT-1
  Result: \textcolor{green}{Passed} - New account can successfully be created, and data is stored successfully in the database. Therefore, the tester was able to verify that the data is 
  persistent, and so this test was successful.
  \item DT-2
  Result: \textcolor{green}{Passed} - Account information can successfully be updated, and the changes are reflected in the database. Therefore, the tester was able to verify
  that the updates are persistent, and so this test was successful.
  \item DT-3
  Result: \textcolor{gray}{Not run} - reason being that the database application we used will ensure the issue brought up by this test can never happen.\\
\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\large{\textbf{Program Information}}}

\normalsize

\begin{enumerate}
  \item PT-1 \textcolor{green}{Passed} - The tester was able to verify that the FAQ system can be viewed by a user (whether they are logged in or not), and so this test was successful.\\
\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\large{\textbf{Searching}}}

\normalsize

\begin{enumerate}
  \item ST-1 \textcolor{gray}{Not run} - Functionality tested by this test was removed from the requirements prior to conducting testing.
  \item ST-2 \textcolor{green}{Passed} - The tester was able to conduct a search based on a patient profile, and view the resulting trials. Therefore, this test was 
  successful.
  \item ST-3 \textcolor{red}{Failed} - When attempting to search for trials with no profile data selected, the app did not behave as intended (it
  still tried to conduct a search), therefore this test was unsuccessful.

\end{enumerate}

the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users)

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
