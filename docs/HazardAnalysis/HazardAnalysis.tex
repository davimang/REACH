\section{Introduction}
This document includes a hazard analysis for the web application REACH. REACH will allow users 
to find clinical trials or research studies they are eligible to participate in. It pulls in information about these studies 
from existing external public databases. This document will analyze and record any hazards to the system REACH. In this case, 
a hazard is a property of a system, together with the condition of the environment the system is in, which can cause harm or 
damage and results in a loss. This definition of hazard is from Nancy Leveson's work.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope and purpose of this hazard analysis is to identify any system hazards and which components they are related to. This 
includes analyzing the causes and effects of the hazard and the recommended actions to mitigate the hazard, as well as documenting 
the resulting safety and security requirements.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\noindent{\textbf{SR-1:}}
The system shall periodically store new trials into an internal database, and remove trials that are no longer active.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} 
In case of external API failure, there should be some redundancy. Keeping a small "cache" of active trials can ensure the system is never
completely down, due to an external failure.\\~\\

\noindent{\textbf{SR-2:}}
The system shall give users a "confidence rating" when matching trials.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} 
It will be nearly impossible for the system to match every single eligible trial perfectly, and the user should know this.\\~\\

\noindent{\textbf{SR-3:}}
The system shall enable the user to put a limit on the number of emails they can receive per day.\\
\textbf{Rationale:}
Some users may only want 1 email per day, and some users may want 10 emails per day. Each user should be able to decide this.\\~\\

\noindent{\textbf{SR-4:}}
The system shall define a pre-set limit number of emails that will be sent to an individual each day.\\
\textbf{Rationale:}
If a user doesn't set a limit (whether on purpose or by accident), the system could not handle sending thousands of emails to each user every day. A limit for this reason, is necessary.\\~\\

\noindent{\textbf{SR-5:}}
The system shall inform a user if it is likely that they have not entered a sufficient amount of information to get accurate search results or narrow down the search in any way.\\
\textbf{Rationale:}
Some users may not realize the importance of entering sufficient and accurate information. Additionally, some may forget.\\~\\
