0,NCT02740868,Xenon-129 Lung Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Study of Healthy Volunteers and Participants With Pulmonary Disease,"Hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance (MR) lung imaging is a relatively new imaging method that allows depiction of both lung function and morphology. Hyperpolarized gases are a new class of MR contrast agent which, when inhaled, provide high temporal and spatial resolution MR images of the lung airspaces. Since no ionizing radiation is involved, hyperpolarized gas MR imaging is ideal for the evaluation of lung diseases especially in children. With hyperpolarized gases, the nuclear spins of the gas atoms are brought into alignment outside of the MR scanner via a process called optical pumping; this yields high polarizations and permits visualization of the lung airspaces with MR imaging (despite the low physical density of the gas in the lung). Two non-radioactive (i.e. stable) isotopes of noble gases helium-3 and xenon-129 can be hyperpolarized. Until recently, higher polarizations could be achieved with helium-3 than with xenon-129, so in humans, helium-3 was more commonly used for hyperpolarized gas MR imaging of the lungs. Recently, the technology has been developed to provide large quantities of highly polarized xenon-129. Helium-3 gas is also extremely expensive and since there are limited reserves of the gas, difficult to procure for research. Unlike helium-3, since xenon-129 is naturally present in the atmosphere, it is less expensive and easier to procure for imaging.

Several applications of xenon-129 MR imaging are under development, including diffusion-weighted and relaxation-weighted imaging. These techniques take advantage of the fact that the rate of loss of xenon-129 polarization is significantly influenced by the local blood flow and concentration of molecular oxygen, as well as the restriction of xenon-129 diffusion by small airway space dimensions. These data can be used to create maps of the lung reflecting regional ventilation/perfusion and micro-airway sizes. Other data that can be obtained with xenon-129 MRI include the volumes of ventilated and unventilated lungs which can subsequently be analyzed to determine the homogeneity of gas distribution within the airspaces. These data can be used to study the structural and functional changes taking place in the lungs associated with pulmonary diseases like CF and asthma. It might provide a diagnostic tool that is able to detect pulmonary diseases more sensitively than the current gold standard measurements of spirometry and plethysmography, and thus prevent irreparable and irreversible damage to the lungs in the early stages of disease.",Recruiting,63.59420603617011,0,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02740868,"Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada",43.70011,-79.4163,63.59420603617011,,giles.santyr@sickkids.ca,Giles Santyr,NF0g5JGAkfgtxgU

3,NCT03455686,Exploring the Utility of Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI in Healthy Volunteers and Patients With Lung Disease,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the ventilation defect percent (VDP), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and/or the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) obtained by analysis of hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI at one or more time-points (over time in the absence of therapeutic intervention or following clinically indicated therapy) in healthy volunteers and patients with lung disease including but not limited to: asthma, emphysema, COPD, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, alpha 1-anti-trypsin deficiency, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

This will be a single centre exploratory study in 10 healthy volunteers with normal lung function and no history of lung disease and 50 patients with a clinical diagnosis of lung disease. There is one study visit required for participation. A subset of participants may be asked to return for up to five additional study visits per year for five years. The purpose of additional study visits is to understand how hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI measurements of lung structure and function change over time in the absence of therapeutic intervention or following clinically indicated therapy.

All subjects will visit St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton and undergo: vital signs, pulmonary function testing, questionnaires, proton (1H) MRI, static ventilation and/or diffusion-weighted 129Xe MRI, and sputum induction.

4,NCT05280418,Tezepelumab on Airway Structure and Function in Patients With Uncontrolled Moderate-to-severe Asthma,"The luminal obstruction in asthma that contributes to symptoms is due to inflammatory cells (usually eosinophils or neutrophils), mucus, smooth muscle constriction, airway wall thickness, or a combination of the above. This obstruction can be regionally visualized and quantified by computed tomography (CT), and its functional consequence can be assessed at high resolution using inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cell derived cytokine that is produced in response to environmental and proinflammatory stimuli, may contribute to all of these features of asthma through its downstream effects on a wide variety of immune (e.g. eosinophils, mast cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), Th2 cell, and Th17 cells) and structural cells (e.g. smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts). Of note, TSLP is believed to upregulate multiple downstream inflammatory pathways, including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 signalling. It is also believed to mediate structural mechanisms that contribute to airway remodelling and smooth muscle dysfunction.

The consequence of blocking TSLP with tezepelumab on airway structure and function has not been investigated. This study will use CT to quantify airway wall and lumen structure according to previously described methods. CT images will also be evaluated for intraluminal plugging and a visual mucus score will be generated. Ventilation heterogeneity in asthmatics, the functional consequence of luminal obstruction, can be regionally measured with high temporal and spatial resolution using inhaled hyperpolarized gas MRI. In asthmatics, focal ventilation defects are observed and these have been shown to be spatially related to airway abnormalities and to respond to bronchoconstriction, bronchodilation, and anti-T2 biologics.

Due to the potential effect of tezepelumab on luminal inflammation, smooth muscle dysfunction and mucus hypersecretion, it is believed that MRI-detectable improvements in ventilation heterogeneity will be observed in asthmatics.",Recruiting,5.935168923997703,0,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05280418,"Hamilton, Ontario L8N 4A6, Canada",43.25011,-79.84963,5.935168923997703,,mkjarsga@stjoes.ca,,NF0g5JGAkfgtxgU
